## 1 Project requirements

The objective of this lab is to study and apply fine-tuning techniques to a banking intent
classification task using the BANKING77 dataset and Unsloth. Specifically, students are
required to complete the following tasks:

- Sample and construct a suitable subset of the BANKING77 dataset for banking intent
    classification.
- Perform data preprocessing and split the sampled dataset into training and testing sets.
- Fine-tune a text classification model using Unsloth and clearly describe all hyperparame-
    ters, techniques, and configurations used.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of the fine-tuned model on an independent test set.
- Implement a standalone inference file that loads the saved checkpoint and predicts the
    intent label of an input message.

## 2 Task requirements

### 2.1 Data preparation and processing

- Students must use the following dataset:
    - BANKING77: BANKING77.
- Students should sample and use only a subset of the dataset to ensure that training can be completed with available computational resources.
- Perform necessary preprocessing steps, including text normalization, label mapping, and basic cleaning if needed.
- Convert the selected intent labels into a format suitable for sequence classification.
- Split the sampled data into train and test sets. Students may optionally create a validation split from the training set for model selection.


### 2.2 Fine-tuning the model with Unsloth

- Students must refer to the official fine-tuning guide: Unsloth.
- Students may use platforms such as Google Colab, Kaggle, or a local machine.
- Clearly document all hyperparameters used:
    - Batch size.
    - Learning rate.
    - Optimizer.
    - Number of training steps or epochs.
    - Maximum sequence length.
    - Any regularization or augmentation techniques used.
- Save the model checkpoint after fine-tuning.

### 2.3 Inference implementation

- After training is completed, students must implement a standalone inference file.
- For consistency in grading, the inference interface must include exactly two main methods:
    - __init__: used to load the configuration file, tokenizer, and model checkpoint.
    - __call__: used to receive an input message and return the predicted label.
- The required format is shown below:

1 class IntentClassification:
2 def __init__(self, model_path):
3 pass
4
5 def __call__(self, message):
6 ...
7 return predicted_label

- The model_path must point to a configuration file that contains at least the path to the
    saved model checkpoint.
- The inference file must be able to load the saved checkpoint and predict the intent label
    for a single text input.
- Students should also provide a short usage example showing how the inference class is
    called after training.

### 2.4 Source code

Students are required to push all source code to their GitHub account with the minimum
requirements following:

- Source code should be organized with a particular format, including folders and files (see
    example):
       banking-intent-unsloth
          |-- scripts
          | |-- train.py
          | |-- inference.py
          | |-- preprocess_data.py
          |
          |-- configs
          | |-- train.yaml
          | |-- inference.yaml
          |
          |-- sample_data
          | |-- train.csv
          | |-- test.csv
          |
          |-- train.sh
          |-- inference.sh
          |-- requirements.txt
          |-- README.md
- README.md must include all descriptions in order to set up environments, download,
    train, and run model.

### 2.5 Video demonstration

- Students must submit one short video demonstrating the inference result of the trained
    model.
- The video should clearly show:
    - How the inference script is executed.
    - At least one example input message.
    - The predicted intent label produced by the model
    - The final accuracy obtained on the test set.
- The video does not need to be long or heavily edited. A simple screen recording is sufficient.
- The recommended duration is 2–5 minutes.
- Students should upload a video to Google Drive and attach a link to the README.md file
    (Students should ensure that this video is public).
